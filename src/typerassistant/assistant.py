        # There is a strange bug that seems to occur within the OpenAI function calling system, in which (I think) the
        # LLM interprets the command name differently if it looks like a file name. For instance, if the command name
        # is "example_1.py.get_current_user" Then the LLM will call this as just "get_current_user", I guess helpfully
        # stripping off what it perceives as an unexpected and unneeded file name.
        #
        # For now, two workarounds, neither perfect:
        # 1. Ask the LLM extra special nice to please not do that. (It works! Mostly! ğŸ¤¯)
        # 2. If no func matches, search again with just the suffix.
        #
        # It's possible that #2 might introduce some nasty problems, and I think for now that's just part of the whole deal
        # with LLMs.
        #
        # TODO report this bug upstream? example_1.py is a small repro. Literally just remove the asking nice part and
        # then ask it to "greet me by name" and it will fail to find the function. (Remove this loop too.)
